## 🚀 About Me  

I am a geologist with over 5 years of experience in mining and\
the oil & gas industries. My expertise includes:

- **Geological Mapping**
- **Core Logging and Reserve Estimation**  
- **Data Analysis and QA/QC**  

Currently, I’m focusing on enhancing my coding skills to
integrate **AI** and **ML** into geosciences. I believe these technologies
can transform resource exploration, optimize carbon capture and
storage (CCS), and drive innovation in the energy sector.
